1. 
shortestPath = O(|V|^2)
the while loop in this method has to look for the node with the lowest cost each time it iterates, so the complexity is squared 

adjacentVertices = O(|E|)
If every edge is adjacent to this vertex the complexity to find each one is that of each edge

edgeCost = O(|E|)
If every edge is is adjacent to this vertex the complexity for worst case to find a single one is that of each edge

2. To test the code I drew out a physical representation of the graph from the edges and tested many paths once I knew the weight to their shortest path options.

3. I did not work with a partner

4. I did not do any extra credit
